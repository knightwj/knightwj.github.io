Thanks to the transparent and detailed data sharing of the individual covid-19 cases on a daily basis by the Shenzhen municipal health commision, we have access to the info regarding the infected people's age,gender,and which city is he/she from, relationship with other cases and so on.   
 </p>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
Data visulization was done by Echarts, Baidu's interactive charting and visulization library,very versatile and handy to use. Relevant info of the library can be found here on the [Echarts website][baidu-echarts].  
 </p>

Here is how the blog highlight code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
